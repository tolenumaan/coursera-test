<section id="samsung"><h3>Samsung</h3><p> Samsung (Hangul: 삼성; hanja: 三星; Korean pronunciation: [sʰamsʰʌŋ]) is a South Korean multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul.[citation needed] It comprises numerous subsidiaries and affiliated businesses,[citation needed] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate).

Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into four business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group. Since 1990s, Samsung has increasingly globalized its activities and electronics, particularly mobile phones and semiconductors, have become its most important source of income.

Notable Samsung industrial subsidiaries include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company measured by 2012 revenues, and 4th in market value),[3] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's 2nd-largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[4] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T (respectively the world's 13th and 36th-largest construction companies).[5] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th-largest life insurance company),[6] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[7] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th-largest advertising agency measured by 2012 revenues).[8][9]</p></section>

<section id="nokia"><h3>Nokia</h3><p>Nokia Corporation[4] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK /ˈnɒkiə/, US /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia is headquartered in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[3] Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[5] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500.[6] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[7]

The company has had various industries in its 150-year history, originally founded as a pulp mill, and currently focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, and technology development and licensing.[8] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was soon overshadowed by competitors. Nokia eventually entered into a pact with Microsoft in 2011 to exclusively use its Windows Phone platform on future smartphones. Its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft in an overall deal totaling €5.44 billion (US $7.17 billion).[9][10] Stephen Elop, Nokia's former CEO, and several other executives joined the new Microsoft Mobile subsidiary of Microsoft as part of the deal, which was completed on April 25, 2014.[11]

Since the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division, its foray in virtual reality, and the acquisitions of French telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent and digital health maker Withings in 2016.[12][13]</p></section>

<section id="xiaomi"><h3>Xiaomi</h3><p>Xiaomi Inc.[3] (Chinese Mandarin: [ɕi̯àu̯mì] ( listen), Chinese: 小米科技; pinyin: Xiǎomǐ Kējì, literally "millet technology";[4] English pronunciation: /ˌʃiaʊˈmiː/) is a privately owned Chinese electronics company headquartered in Beijing. It is the world's 5th largest smartphone maker; in 2015 Xiaomi sold 70.8 million units and accounted for almost 5 percent of the smartphone global market share.[5] Xiaomi designs, develops, and sells smartphones, mobile apps, laptops and related consumer electronics.[6]

Since the release of its first smartphone in August 2011, Xiaomi has gained market share in mainland China and expanded into developing a wider range of consumer electronics, including a smart home (IoT) device ecosystem.[7][8][9][10] The company's founder and CEO is Lei Jun, China's 23rd richest person according to Forbes. The company sold over 60 million smartphones in 2014.[11]

The company has over 8,000 employees, mainly in mainland China, India , Malaysia,[12] and Singapore, and is expanding to other countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Brazil.[13][14]

According to IDC, in October 2014[15] Xiaomi was the third largest smartphone maker in the world, following Samsung and Apple Inc., and followed by Lenovo and LG. Xiaomi became the largest smartphone vendor in China in 2014, having overtaken Samsung, according to an IDC report.[16]

At the end of December 2014, Xiaomi became the world’s most valuable technology start-up after it received US$1.1 billion funding from investors, making Xiaomi's valuation more than US$46 billion.[17] Xiaomi entered the Indian market in July 2014 and since then expanded rapidly in India. Earlier, Xiaomi used to sell exclusively on Flipkart until it announced its partnership with both Amazon.com and Snapdeal on 7 April 2015. This is seen as a bid by the smartphone manufacturer to expand its retail base in India. It has also teamed up with AirTel Store and The Mobile Store to sell some of its selected devices. Later, in Q1 2015, it started its own store and stopped selling its accessories to online stores. On its first anniversary in India, it launched its own Mi Store App. On August 11, 2015, it started its first factory in Sricity, Andhra Pradesh in a partnership with Foxconn.[18]</p></section>

<section id="microsoft"><h3>Microsoft</h3><p>Microsoft Corporation /ˈmaɪkrəˌsɒft, -roʊ-, -ˌsɔːft/[6][7] (commonly referred to as Microsoft) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. It is the world's largest software maker by revenue,[8] and one of the world's most valuable companies.[9]

Microsoft was founded by Paul Allen and Bill Gates on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering, and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date,[10] and in June 2016 announced plans to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.[11][not verified in body]

As of 2015, Microsoft is market dominant in both the IBM PC-compatible operating system (while it lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android[citation needed]) and office software suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the operating systems of Nokia's former phones[12] and Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface, a line of tablet computers.</p></section>
